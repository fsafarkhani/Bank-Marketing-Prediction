## Methods
- Data cleaning: Handling unknowns, outliers, and duplicates
- Feature engineering: Creating new indicators
- Preprocessing: Standardization, one-hot encoding
- Imbalanced data handling: SMOTE
- Model building: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes
- Hyperparameter tuning: GridSearchCV

---

## Results
- **Random Forest** achieved the best accuracy (~90%) before tuning.
- Hyperparameter tuning further optimized model performance.
- Key insights: Students, retirees, and single individuals have higher subscription rates. Cellular contact is more effective than telephone.
